🚀 Getting Started

Option 1: Use the Live Demo

Visit the hosted version: https://nofacechihiro777.github.io/GeoDrive/

Tip: Keep Chrome zoom at 67% for best experience.

Option 2: Run Locally

1. Clone the repository:



git clone https://github.com/nofacechihiro777/GeoDrive.git  
cd GeoDrive

2. Serve the files with any HTTP server:



# Using Python  
python -m http.server 8000  
  
# Using Node.js (http-server)  
npx http-server -p 8000  
  
# Using PHP  
php -S localhost:8000

3. Open http://localhost:8000 in your browser



⚙️ Configuration

Optional: Cesium Ion Token

GeoDrive works without any API keys using flat ArcGIS satellite imagery. However, you can unlock advanced 3D features by adding a free Cesium Ion token:

Features unlocked with a token:

Real terrain elevation (Cesium World Terrain)

OpenStreetMap building footprints

Google Photorealistic 3D tiles (optional)


How to get a token:

1. Sign up at ion.cesium.com (free tier available)


2. Create an access token


3. Open GeoDrive Settings → 3D Imagery Keys


4. Paste your token and click "Apply"



Your token is stored only in your browser's localStorage and is never sent anywhere except to Cesium's servers.

Map Styles (with token)

Terrain + OSM - Real elevation with grey building footprints

Google Photorealistic - Textured 3D mesh from Google (replaces terrain and OSM buildings)

## 🐛 Known Limitations  
  
- Satellite texture on buildings refreshes only at load time (not while driving) to avoid visual pop  
- 3D Cesium mode is first-person only; use 3D CSS mode for third-person chase cam  
- Flight physics are simplified for gameplay, not realistic simulation  
- Requires internet connection for map tiles (unless cached by service worker)
